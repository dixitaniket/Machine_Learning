# Machine_Learning
All machine learning stuff that I did

# Titanic Dataset
the project is still in development 
It predicts the survival of a person based on the feature columns like age ,sex etc.

the model used in the project is randomforestclassifier
To make it work on the system download the folder titanic_project and then compile titanic_analysis.py

The code here is still in development and I would be adding better techniques in the code to make better predicitions
The model achives and accuracy of approx 85 %

# Classic Mnist Dataset using composite Layers and Image Augmentation\
This is the analysis of mnist dataset using Composite model having a CNN and ANN as  its branches.
Also used ImageDataGenerator to do image Augementation thus Increasing number of samples to train the model on
Can Also be used for Fmnist dataset



# Linear_Regression
>generates artifical data and implement linear regression to find the best fitting line
>generates plots from data and also of the best fitting line
